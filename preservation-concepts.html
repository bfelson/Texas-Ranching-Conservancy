<p>Concepts that form the basis of our group's preservation approach</p>

<p>
  This page sets-forth a partial list of philosophical concepts that form the
  basis of our group's preservation approach in the field of rangeland ranching.
  The list is broken down into the following sub-groups: general concepts,
  rangeland ranching concepts, and rangeland concepts. The concepts can be used
  by teachers as topics for classroom discussion, and as topics for challenging
  students to think! If you have any questions or comments on any of the
  concepts we are presenting, or if you have a concept or opinion that needs to
  be considered, please don't hesitate giving us a holler!

  General concepts Principle components of our state's, our country's old-time
  ranching heritage, culture, and pastoral way of life are: mid- and large-size
  working ranches vast undivided areas of agriculturally and ecologically
  important rangeland -- either desert, prairie, savanna, or forest type
  old-time ranching skills and traditions full-time working ranchers and cowboys
  special breeds, strains, and bloodlines of ranch horses, stock dogs, and
  range-adapted livestock -- including cattle, sheep, and goats highly
  nutritious range-aged beef climax species of native range grasses and forbs
  healthy populations of range-dependent wildlife Examples of old-time ranching
  skills and traditions include both ranch-house and chuck-wagon cooking,
  bunkhouse living, cowboy poetry and song, training cutting and roping horses,
  training stock dogs, managing where livestock graze, annual fall and spring
  round-ups, penning and working cattle, trail drives, and loading cattle for
  shipping. The greatest threat to our country's old-time ranching heritage,
  culture, and pastoral way of life is loss of mid- and large-size working
  ranches, and loss of spacious areas of agriculturally and ecologically
  important rangelands. Preserving our state's, our country's remaining mid- and
  large-size working ranches is important because after they are gone, the
  cultural lifestyle and wildlife they support, the agricultural products they
  produce, as well as the ecological services their grazing land provide will be
  gone too. Livestock ranching in harmony with native rangelands requires
  ranchers, cowboys, livestock, and rangelands to coexist over time without
  degrading the range's soil, water, vegetation, and wildlife resources. Any
  serious approach towards minimizing the negative effects of man-induced
  greenhouse gas emissions on the environment must include offering private
  ranch owners in Texas and other range states and regions a financial incentive
  to manage native rangelands for carbon sequestration and other ecological
  purposes, as well as for low stocking rate livestock grazing. Offering
  full-time working ranchers a financial incentive to practice light stocking
  and other sound range management practices would be an effective way to
  improve the financial, ecological, and social viability of rangeland ranching
  improve the agricultural and ecological health of our country's rangelands for
  the benefit of society mitigate long-term climate change, and minimize the
  negative effects of man-made global warming. Other ways to demonstrate
  responsible use of taxpayer money would be to employ qualified full-time
  working ranchers to manage the conservation of our country's agriculturally
  and ecologically important rangelands employ unemployed people in towns and
  cities to help remove invading brush, and do other types of rangeland
  conservation and restoration work. Trends in loss of mid- and large-size
  working ranches, and vast areas of agriculturally and ecologically important
  rangeland tend to parallel trends in population growth, and trends in public
  demand for small tracks of rangeland for residential and commercial
  development purposes. Rangeland ranching concepts The hardest thing about
  rangeland ranching, as a vocational way of life, is achieving financial and
  social prosperity and happiness without degrading and fragmenting our
  country's agriculturally and ecologically important rangelands in the process.
  Most rangeland ranches in Texas have been degraded and fragmented to the point
  where they no longer have enough animal unit carrying capacity to make
  rangeland ranching financially viable on an one-operation (independent) basis.
  If Texas continues losing mid- and large-size working ranches in the same
  amounts as was lost during the past fifty years, it won't be long before
  there's nothing left to preserve or restore, especially in the southern,
  central, and coastal regions of our state. In order for small- and mid-size
  operations to achieve long-term prosperity in the range cattle business, they
  must be willing to do the following three things: (1) work in association with
  local or regional ranchers; (2) opt for a common ranching philosophy; and (3)
  opt for a common method of ranching. Three principle requirements for
  preserving rangeland ranching in Texas and other range states and regions are:
  recognizing past and present rangeland ranching problems and mistakes
  replacing past and present rangeland ranching problems and mistakes with
  viable solutions opting for a method of rangeland ranching that is financially
  viable, ecologically responsible, and socially acceptable, and can be
  maintained over an indefinite period of time without degrading the ranges
  soil, water, vegetation, and wildlife resources. The cornerstone of long-term
  (sustainable) rangeland ranching is practicing sound range management on a
  year-in and year-out basic. Rangeland concepts It's a simple fact that further
  degradation and fragmentation of our state's, our country's agriculturally and
  ecologically important rangelands, in conjunction with further emissions of
  "greenhouse" gases in the atmosphere will end-up intensifying the damaging
  effects of man-induced climate change and man-induced global warming. It is
  way past time for people around the world to begin appreciating the ecosystem
  goods and services that healthy rangelands provide for the long-term welfare
  of society. Examples of ecosystem goods and services that healthy rangelands
  provide for societal benefit include: healthy food, natural fiber, and
  valuable by-products for human consumption natural habitat for grazing
  cultures, livestock, wildlife, and fish recharge of below- and above-ground
  aquifers purification of water going into aquifers, streams, and rivers
  watershed protection and natural flood control maintains soil and ecological
  buffering capacity regenerates soil and water fertility creates new soil, thus
  improves carbon storage capacity creates and maintains vascular structures for
  delivering soil and water nutrients to plants removes carbon dioxide and other
  "greenhouse" emissions out of the atmosphere transmits life-supporting oxygen
  in the air sequesters carbon in below and above-ground biomass detoxifies and
  degrades waste materials and pollution climate change mitigation maintains
  diversity in native flora and fauna natural control of pathogenic and
  parasitic organisms habitat for pollinators of cultivated and wild plants
  opportunities for hunting, fishing, and other types of recreation natural
  setting for cultural, social, and spiritual enrichment. Reality tells us that
  a high percent of our state's, our country's agriculturally and ecologically
  important rangelands have been severely degraded, fragmented, and polluted by
  human activities and development, and they no longer provide high levels of
  plant and animal life. Further degradation and fragmentation of our state's,
  our country's agriculturally and ecologically important rangelands will lead
  to further increase in man-induced climate change and an intensified rate of
  man-induced global warming further decrease in ecosystem goods and services
  that rangelands provide for human survival further decrease in natural habitat
  for ranchers, cowboys, livestock, wildlife, and fish further demise of our
  state's, our country's rangeland ranching heritage, culture, and pastoral way
  of life. Sorry to say that very few people in the U.S. and around the world
  recognize the importance for preserving native rangeland types and areas with
  high agricultural and ecological value to society. Based on past and current
  trends in loss of agriculturally and ecologically important rangelands around
  the world, the only rangeland types that will be left for the benefit of
  future generations will be the least productive types, or in other words, the
  rangelands with the lowest agricultural and ecological value to society. Under
  natural condition, desert and short-grass rangelands are extremely stingy when
  it comes to passing out ecosystem goods and services for supporting life.
  Comment - Also stingy are mid-grass and tall-grass types that have been ruined
  by range degradation and fragmentation. Or, in other words, rangeland types
  that are no longer agriculturally and ecologically valuable. Man-induced
  degradation, fragmentation, and pollution of vast areas of prairie and savanna
  rangeland leads to permanent loss of healthy populations of white-tail deer,
  pronghorn antelope, mule deer, bob-white quail, and other species of
  range-dependent wildlife. Large wildlife numbers on degraded and fragmented
  rangelands, coupled with a reduction in natural predators (cougars, wolves,
  etc.), results in reducing the growth rate, body size, and body condition of
  range-dependent wildlife. Comment - It also results in causing more disease
  and high death rates. Sad to say that past and present ruin of our state's,
  our country's agriculturally and ecologically important rangelands (mostly
  mid-grass and tall-grass prairie and savanna types) by human activities and
  development has has been and continues to be done one small piece at a time,
  and presently there are no signs of stopping the destruction. Comment -
  Hopefully this land-use trend can be changed before all hope is lost. Trying
  to regenerate native rangelands destroyed by human-induced degradation,
  fragmentation, and pollution is a slow and time-consuming process, and may
  required hundreds or thousands of years to accomplish. In fact, native
  rangelands destroyed by human activities and development may be lost forever,
  no matter what people say, think, or do. There are no man-made (artificial)
  substitutes for the ecosystem goods and services that our country's, our
  planet's rangelands provide for the benefit of societies around the world.
  Comment - Once they are gone, they are gone forever, and our country's, our
  planet's per animal unit carrying capacity is reduced to what our country's,
  our planet's remaining rangelands are able to support. Accumulative loss of
  agriculturally and ecologically important rangelands around the world, in
  conjunction with an always growing population, leads to world-wide poverty,
  malnutrition, famine, disease, anarchy, immigration, and fighting for
  existence. Comment - Or, in other words, will lead to reducing the quality of
  life for present and future generations around the world. Humans are the only
  animal species that destroy the life-support system that Nature has provided
  for their survival, and describe their destruction as "making progress".
  Civilizations throughout human history have demonstrated the ability to plant
  seeds, grow crops, and build cities and empires, but zero have demonstrated
  the ability to recreate the agriculturally and ecologically important
  rangelands that civilized man has destroyed by his farming agriculture,
  resource mining, energy extraction, urbanization, and other types of
  man-induced activities and development. Comment - It seems like civilized man
  is destined to plant, grow, build, explore, and technologically advance
  himself right out of existence.
