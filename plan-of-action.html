  Our group's recommended plan of action for accomplishing our mission is
  centered around encouraging working ranchers in Texas and other range states
  and regions to incorporate the following initiatives in their respective
  ranching approach: Opting for a METHOD OF RANCHING that's financially viable,
  ecologically responsible, and socially acceptable, and can be maintained over
  an indefinite period of time without degrading and fragmenting our country's
  agriculturally and ecologically important rangelands; Organizing a WORKING
  RANCHERS ASSOCIATION for the purpose of strengthening the procurement,
  marketing, and political power of associated members, and consequently
  offering them an opportunity to strengthen their financial, ecological, and
  social position in the ranching business; Establishing a RANGE-AGED BEEF
  COUNCIL for the purpose of doing the following work: Promoting the marketing
  of range-aged beef out of cattle that are physically mature and are no longer
  growing additional carcass, and out of cattle that are born, grown-out, and
  fattened on native range; Promoting the benefits of range-aged beef to
  health-conscious consumers; Enlisting the use of a REGISTERED TRADE NAME --
  such as Rangeland, Texland, Rangemaster, Forager, etc. -- for promoting the
  production and marketing of range-adapted breeding stock and range-aged beef.
  We feel certain that how well each of the above initiatives are carried-out by
  full-time working ranchers, as individuals and groups, could determine the
  fate of our state's, our country's old-time ranching heritage, culture, and
  pastoral way of life. Our group is open to suggestions concerning changes or
  additions to the above plan. All you need to do is give us a holler!
