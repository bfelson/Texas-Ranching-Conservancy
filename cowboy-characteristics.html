<p>Common characteristics of working cowboys</p>

<p>
  It should be noted that the following characteristics have been noticed over
  the years, and are common with the working cowboys that I've known and worked
  with: Like simplicity and tranquility in their everyday lives. Have problems
  finding and keeping wives that are willing to stay with them and be happy
  living their simple way of life. Very appreciative of the natural surroundings
  around them. Enjoy their freedom and are very protective of it. Prefer staying
  away from large crowds and cites. Dislikes people that don't show respect for
  themselves, their peers, elders, or women, and that mistreat kids. Like being
  a cowboy because of the work, lifestyle and purpose, not because of the pay.
  Know how to ride a horse, throw a good loop, and handle all types of
  livestock, no matter how wild, mean, or docile. Most prized possessions are a
  good trained horse and stock dog, a good hand-made saddle, a good dallying
  rope, their chaps, their boots, their hat, and a scarf to tie around their
  neck. Treat their pet dog like he or she is their best friend. Like sitting
  around the dinner table or campfire drinking coffee and chewing the fat with
  family, friends, and acquaintances. Believe that good full-time cowboy work is
  getting harder and harder to find, and in time will probably disappear all
  together.
