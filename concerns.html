  Nol Ward's primary concerns about the future of rangeland ranching and
  rangelands
</p>

<p>
  Loss of real working ranches with enough scale and diversification to be
  financially, ecologically, and socially viable. Loss of large areas of
  agriculturally and ecologically important rangelands in Texas and other range
  states and regions. Loss of life-supporting ecosystem goods and services that
  rangelands provide for the benefit of society. Loss of a pastoral way of life
  that is simple, peaceful, self-fulfilling, and in touch with the natural
  world. Loss of full-time working ranchers and cowboys, well-trained ranch
  horses and stock dogs, range-adapted livestock, and healthy range-aged
  grassfed beef. Loss of healthy breeding populations of range-dependent
  wildlife -- such as pronghorn antelope, mule deer, white-tail deer, bobwhite
  quail, as well as many species of raptors and song birds. Loss of rangeland
  ranching as an agriculturally important institution on the plains and prairies
  of North America.
