      Historically, Texas and other range states have been characterized around
      the world as a land of large working ranches, wide-open spaces, large
      expanses of rangeland, oceans of grass, cowboys and horses, large herds of
      cattle, tasty rangefed beef, and abundance of wildlife. Yet the truth is
      that since the late 1800's and early 1900's, the earliest days of our
      country's range cattle industry, the type of ranches that made Texas and
      other range states famous have been shrinking in size, number, and
      productivity. The primary reason for the losses is because, over the
      years, financial returns from rangeland ranching have been very low, and
      ranchers seldom have a financial incentive to maintain their rangeland in
      good to excellent range condition. As a result, ranchers frequently
      overstock, thus degrade their rangeland in an attempt to improve their
      financial position or prevent further loss sell all or part of their
      rangeland in an attempt to recoup financial losses, pay-off debt, or in
      order to have enough money to live on after retirement attempt to improve
      their financial position by converting agriculturally and ecologically
      important rangeland into ecologically degrading and environmentally
      polluting farmland allow their rangeland to be fragmented into smaller,
      less financially viable operating units with the passing of each
      generation of owners. Unfortunately, due to a history of ranchers
      degrading and fragmenting their rangeland in an attempt to improve their
      financial position, a high percent of the old-time working ranches in
      Texas and other range states and regions have been degraded and fragmented
      to the point where they no longer have enough animal unit carrying
      capacity to be financially viable on an one-operation (independent) basis.
      In fact, a high percent of our state's, our country's old-time working
      ranches -- which includes desert, prairie, savanna, and forest types --
      have been degraded and fragmented to the point where operating them as
      grazing operations is a total waste of time and money, and any attempt to
      do so must be avoided. Because of a growing demand for ranchettes, hunting
      reserves, country housing, public recreation, and other types of human
      activities and development endeavors, many of today's ranch owners are
      choosing to improve their financial position by simply selling their
      ranches to speculators and developers, and doing so one piece of rangeland
      at a time. Because of today's trends in population growth and urban
      sprawl, most ranch owners choosing this financial alternative can find
      plenty of buyers for about any amount and quality of rangeland they want
      to sell. For example, during the 1990s, more than quarter-million acres of
      Texas rangeland was lost each year to subdividing, and the number and size
      of our state's old-time working ranches declined tremendously. NOW, before
      our state's, our country's remaining mid- and large-size working ranches
      become chopped-up into little pieces and lost forever, efforts must be
      made to preserve as much of what's left as possible for the benefit of
      future generations. Doing this is critical because after all of our
      state's, our country's old-time working ranches are gone, the cultural
      lifestyle and wildlife they support, the agricultural goods they produce,
      as well as the ecological services their grazing land provide will be gone
      too. Because of today's growing demand for small tracks of rangeland
      (which is expected to nearly double in Texas by 2050), we feel that having
      any chance to prevent further loss of mid- and large-size working ranches,
      and therefore prevent further loss of our state's, our country's old-time
      ranching heritage, culture, and pastoral way of life, will require
      like-minded people joining together as a group for the purpose of setting
      forth and supporting a plan for accomplishing such an objective. We
      believe that immediate action on this requirement is necessary!
