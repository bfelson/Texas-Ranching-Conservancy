      Texas Ranching Conservancy (TRC) is an education-ordinated social group
      comprised of people interested in the following endeavors: (1) promoting the
      preservation of old-time working ranches in Texas and other range states and
      regions; and (2) promoting the preservation of native rangeland types and
      areas that are agriculturally and ecologically valuable to society. Other
      areas of commitment include promoting the preservation of old-time ranching
      skills and traditions full-time working ranchers and cowboys special breeds,
      strains, and bloodlines of ranch horses, stock dogs, range-adapted cattle,
      as well as other types of domestic livestock healthy range-aged beef climax
      species of native range forage healthy populations of range-dependent
      wildlife. We believe that by serving as a source for useful information in
      the field of rangeland ranching, we can in time (hopefully before it's too
      late) play an important role in preserving what's left of our state's, our
      country's old-time ranching heritage, culture, and pastoral way of life, and
      do so for the benefit of present and future generations. As a result of
      today's rapid loss in number, size, and productivity of our state's, our
      country's old-time working ranches -- especially the prairie, savanna, and
      forest types in Texas and southeast states like Louisiana, Georgia, and
      Florida -- we believe our mission is crucial. Our group welcomes anyone,
      people from all walks of life, who shares our concern about the future for
      rangeland ranching, as well as the future of our state's, our country's
      native rangelands. We are always needing motivated people to help us
      accomplish our group's mission objectives. If you are interested in becoming
      a member of our group, and helping us promote our conservancy work, please
      don't hesitate giving us a holler! Yes, your help would be very much
      appreciated!
