  Nol Ward, our group's founder, is a veteran of the ranching business, with
  more than 50 years of working, managing, and consulting experience. During
  this time, he was able to compare differences between operations that were
  financially viable, ecologically responsible, and long-lasting; and operations
  that were high-cost, natural resource degrading, and short-lived. He feels
  like he spent most of his working life searching for and applying viable
  solutions to past and present problems and mistakes. Nol's primary areas of
  interest in the field of rangeland ranching are managing the conservation of
  mid-grass, tall-grass, and forest rangelands breeding, raising, and marketing
  of superior-quality, range-adapted breeding stock production and marketing of
  superior-quality, range-aged grassfed beef. His favorite ranch work is
  managing where cattle graze, and doing so from the back of a horse. His
  favorite areas of diversification is providing the public an opportunity to
  take advantage of recreational activities such as get-away lodging,
  ranch-style dining, camp-fire cookouts, nature tours, and managed hunting and
  fishing. Nol's philosophy toward ranching is based on accumulated knowledge
  gained from the following sources: Years of studying the history of rangeland
  ranching in the U.S. and around the world. Years of listening to elders,
  friends, and acquaintances tell stories about different experiences,
  occurrences, and accrued knowledge during their lives and the lives of others,
  since early pioneer days, since early formation of the range cattle industry.
  Years of observing the gradual disappearance of working ranches on the
  prairies and savannas of Texas and other Gulf Coast states. Years of watching
  solar powered bovines being slowly transformed into fossil fuel powered
  machines. Years of trial and error experimenting, re-valuating, and correcting
  as a small independent rancher, professional ranch manager, and beef cattle
  consultant. Years of trying to preserve ranch-life in an environment where
  people, livestock, rangelands, and wildlife coexist together for the
  long-term. Nol attended college at Stephen F. Austin State University. He has
  degrees in economics, political science, and agriculture. His study in
  agriculture was in the fields of range and tame pasture management, as well as
  livestock breeding programs. Over the years, he has received numerous awards
  for outstanding accomplishments in range and pasture management, as well as
  soil and water conservation. In addition to being founding member of the Texas
  Ranching Conservation, he is a founding member of the International Braford
  Association, and a founding member of the Texas Forage and Grassland Council.
  Over the years, he has been recognized as a rancher, manager, consultant,
  conservationist, and naturalist. After a hitch in the Army and before
  graduating from college, Nol got his start in ranching as a small independent
  rancher, gaining experience and knowledge about the business. Because of a
  lack of scale in his beginning efforts, he was forced to supplement his income
  by baling and hauling hay, catching and hauling cattle, and doing other type
  of ranching related work. Later, he had the opportunity to put his experience
  and knowledge to work as a commission cattle buyer, professional ranch
  manager, and beef cattle consultant. His specialty as a cattle buyer was
  buying and selling Brahman-influenced breeding stock. His specialty as a beef
  cattle consultant was managing closed breeding programs, keeping herd records,
  and evaluating beef herd performance. Most of his time as a ranch manager and
  consultant was spent developing optimally adapted bovines for prairie,
  savanna, and forest type ranching environments. Nol started off in the
  ranching business fundamentally opposed to government subsidy programs, and
  had a basic dislike for regulatory agendas. But, over the years, he gradually
  changed his opinion. He now believes that a USDA conservation program for
  rangelands is needed to promote light stocking and other sound range
  management practices. That is, if ranchers and people in general in Texas and
  other range states and regions are serious about preventing further demise of
  our country's range cattle industry, as well as further degradation and
  fragmentation of country's most productive rangelands. He is hopeful that our
  representatives in government will come to the same conclusion before all
  efforts to preserve our state's, our country's rangeland ranching heritage,
  culture, and pastoral way of life becomes a totally lost and unachievable
  endeavor. Nol's late-life ambition has been to solicit professional and public
  support for organizing, establishing, and carrying forward a public or private
  rangeland ranching project for both education and historical preservation
  purposes. One important objective of the project would be to restore old-time
  ranching remnants, and permanently maintaining them in optimum agricultural
  and ecological condition for the benefit of present and future generations.
  Another objective would be to work toward developing an unique line of
  range-adapted cattle and an unique line of range-aged beef. Estimated time
  period for accomplishing the project's objectives would be no less than three
  or more generations of closed population breeding and rigid objective
  selection. The three generations will have to be on both the dam and sire side
  of the pedigree of each animal in the project. Nol is hopeful that the many
  generations of accumulated knowledge presented at this website (which includes
  his personal ranching method and philosophy) doesn't turnout to be a waste of
  time and effort, and just more forgotten information. He hopes the information
  will, at some point in time, make a difference in preserving our country's
  rangeland ranching heritage, culture, and pastoral way of life. And, he is
  hopeful that the information will help develop a deep appreciation for the
  important role that properly managed rangeland ranching can play in
  safeguarding the general welfare of societies around the world. Nol is now
  retired and living in East Texas with his wife of more than fifty years. Since
  he isn't able to work, most of his time is spent either sitting on the porch
  watching for passing wildlife, or searching the internet for useful
  information. And, whenever possible, he watches Texas Rangers baseball on T.V.
  He also spends time thinking about his life experiences, and about ways to
  challenge people to think. His major regret in life is not knowing what he
  knows now when he was a young man getting started in the ranching and cattle
  business.
