  General Ranching Concepts The Golden Rule for sustainable ranching is never
  taking more from the land than the land can sustain over time. Grazing
  livestock on indigenous rangelands is deemed fully sustainable provided that
  the agricultural and ecological integrity of the land is preserved. In order
  to be sustainable, a ranching operation must be made financially viable,
  ecologically responsible, and socially acceptable. Social values are often the
  underlying variable that hinders or encourages the development of a
  sustainable ranching system. Degrading and subdividing large tracks of
  agriculturally and ecologically important rangeland poses the greatest threat
  to the future of vocational ranching in Texas and other range states and
  regions. Years of instability and low profitability in ranching leads to
  ranchers degrading and subdividing their grazing land in an attempt to recoup
  financial losses, pay off debt, or have enough money to live on after
  retirement. Pride of independent ownership and management are major stumbling
  blocks that impede establishing a sustainable ranching enterprise.
  Substituting tame pastures, purchased feed, and/or baled hay for native range
  forage is a quick way to becoming history in the ranching business. Being a
  part owner of a large-scale, professionally managed, financially viable
  ranching enterprise is a far better option than being a full owner of a
  small-scale, traditionally managed, unprofitable enterprise. The hardest thing
  about the ranching business is achieving financial prosperity and happiness
  without degrading and ultimately destroying the ranch's soil, water,
  vegetation, and wildlife resources. Most ranches in Texas and other range
  states and regions have been degraded and fragmented to the point were they no
  longer have enough animal unit grazing capacity to be financially viable on an
  one-operation, independent basis. Operating a sustainable closed system
  ranching system requires having no less than approximately 500 head of
  breeding stock, and the EQUIVALENCE of no less than approximately 16,500 acres
  of mid-grass rangeland that's in good to excellent range condition.
  Sustainable ranching on a small-scale sustainable basis requires local and
  regional producers working together according to a common method of livestock
  production and marketing. Diversification plays an important role in making
  the ranching business profitable and sustainable. The method of
  diversification that offers ranchers an opportunity to improve the
  profitability of their operations with the least amount of financial outlay is
  contracting with a government or private organization to graze fewer livestock
  and grow more range forage for carbon sequestration and climate control
  purposes. Beef Cattle Concepts Functional cattle are bred and selected for
  their ability to convert foodstuff that non-ruminant animals (swine, poultry
  and fish) cannot convert more efficiently than ruminate bovines can. The only
  reason for raising beef cattle is to convert native range forage into meat,
  leather, and valuable by-products for human consumption. The ability of cattle
  to convert range forage efficiently can be lost by the excessive use of grain
  and the selection of cattle without ample middles. Cattle that have the
  ability to convert range forage efficiently do not require a heavy investment
  in supplementary feed in order to stay in good body condition and be
  productive. Most beef cattle in the U.S. have lost the ability to convert
  range forage effectively without a heavy investment in supplementary feed.
  Most cattle in the U.S. are bred to meet the needs of industrial agriculture
  (agricultural universities, commercial feed-yards, supply companies, etc.),
  not the needs of rangeland ranchers. Most beef cattle in the U.S. are bred in
  open populations, and selected primarily on the basis of breed, breeding
  percentage, pedigree background, show-ring performance, color, size, growth,
  and/or milking ability. Beef cattle bred in open populations are not
  predictable breeders and do not produce uniform quality offspring. Cattle must
  be given additional protein and energy when the forage in their diet does not
  meet minimum nutritive requirements. Highly productive cattle of any breed or
  cross do very poorly when moved to a lower elevation and a climate nearer the
  tropics (Alto Adams Jr.). Cattle do best when bred in the environment in which
  they are raised. (Alto Adams Jr.) Any animal that seems to be accident or
  disease prone should be culled from the herd rather than receive a lot of
  individual attention. (Alto Adams Jr.) Multi-sire breeding of best bulls to
  best cows within a closed population preserves the strength and soundness of a
  herd of cattle. (Alto Adams Jr.) Longevity is an inherent trait and should be
  retained in cattle. (Alto Adams Jr.) Improving productive longevity in a herd
  of cattle requires selecting bulls out of dams with the best udders and most
  proven track records. Large herds allow for greater flexibility in bull
  selection. (Alto Adams Jr.) Preventing close inbreeding in a herd of cattle
  requires changing sires before they have a chance to mate with their
  offspring, dams, or sisters. Herd replacements should be selected out of good
  cows that calved on schedule without assistance (Alto Adams Jr.). A surplus of
  heifers should be saved and exposed to bulls at an early age (Alto Adams Jr.).
  Heifers that breed first should be retained as cow replacements. (Alto Adams
  Jr.) Maximizing calf-crop numbers at the lowest feasible cost requires
  scheduling each year's breeding season to coincide with time periods of peak
  forage quality. Avoid the use of any breed or cross of cattle that have heavy
  birth weights, large frames, high milking ability, and maximum growth rates.
  Best cattle for low-input ranching are moderate growth cattle with heavy
  muscling, low birth weights, small to medium body size, low to moderate milk,
  and dark pigmentation, and do not require large amounts of supplementary feed
  to be productive. Best breed types for low-input ranching include but are not
  limited to purebred or crossbred Angus, Cracker, Yak, Dexter, Gyr, Hereford,
  Jersey, Kerry, Lowline, Muscles, Red Poll, and Shorthorn. Best breeding plan
  for a sustainable ranch is using rigid, objective selection and closed
  population breeding to develop a distinct breed, strain, or bloodline of
  general-purpose cattle. The fifteen most important traits in a herd of
  general-purpose range cattle are temperament early sexual maturity fertility
  calving ease bunching instinct herding ability predator protection mothering
  ability acceptable growth easy fleshing ability active libido in bulls
  hardiness production longevity visual appearance (conformation) carcass merit
  The key to developing highly prepotent cattle is rigid, objective trait
  selection within a closed breeding population. Optimally adapted,
  general-purpose range cattle have the ability to produce top-quality
  acceptable slaughter animals and superior herd replacements while pasturing
  lightly stocked native range in a cost efficient manner. A simple breeding
  plan centered around mating best sons produced out of one breeding group
  (within a closed population) to best daughters produced out of another offers
  ranchers an opportunity to raise highly acceptable slaughter animals and
  superior herd replacements. It requires three or more generations of
  uninterrupted closed-herd breeding and rigid objective selection, following
  the protocol of a sound beef herd management plan, in order to develop a
  superior herd of general-purpose cattle. Operating a closed-breeding system on
  a sustained basis requires maintaining a permanent gene pool of no less than
  approximately 500 head of adult breeders. Large herd numbers offer greater
  genetic diversity, offer greater selection opportunities, and minimizes
  inbreeding problems in a closed population of cattle. Three generations of
  culling inferior traits will eliminate most genetic problems in a herd of
  cattle unless the problems are reintroduced in the herd through outside bulls.
  (Alto Adams, Jr.) Genetic improvement created by mating cattle within a closed
  population is measurable, cumulative and permanent, and can be sustained over
  an infinite period of time. (Alto Adams Jr.) Lack of the right kind of
  replacements that will allow culling a herd properly is a serious problem and
  a major factor affecting the rapidity of developing a superior herd of
  general-purpose cattle. (Alto Adams, Jr.) The exact amount of time required to
  develop a superior herd of general-purpose cattle is determined by the
  following three factors: Level of genetic merit in the producer's foundation
  cattle The producer's level of selection intensity How well the producer
  adheres to sound beef herd management protocol. A superior herd of
  general-purpose cattle is developed on the basis of breeding the best to the
  best, year after year, within a closed population, and allowing temperament,
  reproduction, survival, and yearling weight largely determine which cattle are
  best. There are no shortcuts, technological or otherwise, to developing a herd
  of most suitable cattle for a low-input ranching operation. Developing and
  maintaining a functionally superior herd of general-purpose cattle involves
  mating mature cows to breeding-age bulls that meet the following sire
  standards: Born naturally, without any help Out of a cow that has been a
  regular breeder in a multi- or single-sire herd beginning around her first
  birthday Out of a cow with a good to excellent udder Good to excellent on the
  basis of weight and visual appearance when evaluated as a yearling bull
  Optimum frame score, reflective of a bull that can sire herd replacements best
  adapted to the rancher's respective ranching environment. Most any bull when
  mated to enough cows will sire a few top quality calves -- a good
  straight-bred or cross-bred bull will sire more -- but only a top-quality bull
  that has generations of closed herd breeding and rigid, objective selection
  behind him from both the sire and dam side of his pedigree will sire the most.
  When selecting sires, close attention should be paid to bulls with above
  average yearling weights. (Lasater Ranch, Matheson Colorado) Exposing virgin
  heifers to lightweight bulls that sire calves with low birth weight minimizes
  the chance of permanently injuring yearling heifers at mating time, and
  minimizes the chance of having calving problems with first-calf heifers.
  Developing and maintaining a functionally superior herd of general-purpose
  cattle should be viewed as a never-ending process of extending the influence
  of superior animals and culling the influence of inferior animals within a
  closed population. Beef Cattle Marketing Concepts Small and medium-size
  ranching operations have little or no marketing power. Small and medium-size
  ranching operations can begin overcoming their marketing disadvantages by
  organizing a local or regional marketing alliance. In order for a cooperative
  marketing arrangement to work effectively, the allied ranchers must be willing
  opt for a common method of ranching, follow standardized operating procedures,
  and employ an experienced professional to coordinate the operation of their
  marketing co-op. Emphasis in beef cattle marketing needs to be directed toward
  optimizing financial returns from ranching through the sale of unique quality
  "trade-name" breeding stock and unique quality "trade-name" meat. Terms such
  as Rangemaster, Range-land, and Tex-land can be used as an effective trade
  name for promoting the breeding and marketing of highly valued breeding stock,
  as well as the marketing and consumption of highly valued meat. Selecting when
  and which bulls to turn-out with the rancher's herd is the first step in a
  sound beef cattle marketing program. Only animals that meet minimum
  performance standards for their contemporary group should be selected for
  marketing as breeding stock. Animals that fail to meet minimum performance
  standards for their contemporary group should be removed from the herd and
  marketed as meat, never as breeding stock. To be reputation building, grassfed
  beef must be tasty, tender, uniform in quality, and free of additives proven
  by scientific research or perceived by consumers as being unhealthy. The
  highest valued grassfed beef in the world is produced out of cattle that have
  reached sexual maturity and are no longer growing addition carcass, and out of
  cattle that are born, grown-out, and finished on native range. New
  technological breakthroughs such as precision flake cutting makes it possible
  to improve the market value of meat out of cull bulls and cows slaughtered
  straight-off grass. Range Management Concepts Sound range management is the
  cornerstone of a sustainable ranching system. The primary objective of range
  management is to manipulate the grazing of large herbivores so both plant and
  animal production can be maintained or increased. Projecting the long-term
  carrying capacity of the rancher's native grazing land is the first step in a
  sound range management program. Five essential practices in sound range
  management are: Keeping stocking rates 30 to 40% below projected long-term
  carrying capacity; Keeping cattle bunched together while they are grazing
  (rather than allowing them to spread out over the range), and never allowing
  cattle to linger around their preferred grazing areas (Be sure to keep cattle
  moving so they can't spot-overgraze the ranch's grazing land); Minimizing
  lingering time around watering points and riparian areas. Never allowing
  cattle to re-graze a particular range area until it has fully recovered from
  the previous grazing period; Giving key forage species a chance to product a
  seed crop, especially on years following a long extended drought. The stocking
  rate of rangeland should never exceed 60 to 70% of its projected long-term
  carrying capacity. When stocking rates are figured on the basis of annual
  forage production, desert rangelands should be stocked for 10 to 15% usage of
  key forage species, short-grass rangelands for 20 to 25% usage, mid-grass
  rangelands for 30 to 35% usage, and tall-grass rangelands for 40 to 45% usage.
  Loss of range forage because of grazing, browsing, trampling, rodent and
  insect damage, prescribed burns, wild fires, and drought must be taken into
  consideration when determining the stocking rates. If a drought lasts long
  enough, a light stocking rate can become an extremely heavy stocking rate.
  Developing programs that offer ranchers an opportunity to financially benefit
  from managing their grazing land for ecological purposes plays an important
  role in making sound range management ecologically viable. The root cause for
  overstocking and overgrazing is ranchers overloading their grazing land with
  grazers and browsers in an attempt to improve the profitability of their
  operations. Overstocking is a function of numbers and overgrazing is a
  function of both numbers and time.
