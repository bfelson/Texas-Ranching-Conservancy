<p>Characteristics of a Sustainible Ranch</p>

<p>
  "The Golden Rule for sustainable ranching is never taking more from the land
  than the land can sustain over time." -- Nol Ward

<p>
  Presented here is a list of operational characteristics that Nol has compiled
  over the years while working, managing, and consulting on different ranches
  and cattle operations. He believes that when all the characteristics are
  combined together, they form the basis of a sustainable ranch, or in other
  words, the basis of an ideal community. The list is separated into three
  groups: 1) operational characteristics, 2) ecological characteristics, and 3)
  social characteristics.

  Operational characteristics Owned by conservation-minded individuals,
  communities, or countries. Day to day management is left up to professionals
  who have years of experience and demonstrate exceptional management ability.
  Operation is private or public owned, large-scale, well-managed, natural
  resource conserving, ecological responsible, vertically integrated, highly
  diversified, and optimum profit-motivated. Operation utilizes large areas of
  rangeland with an optimum amount of labor and and a minimum amount of
  financial input and risk. Management works with local and regional ranchers
  having common goals and objectives. In time, operation becomes largely
  self-supporting. Managers take a very conservative, low-input, low-risk
  approach toward ranch management. The ranch is stocked at a very light
  stocking rate. Livestock are grazed according to a proven, low-cost,
  rotational grazing plan. The day to day grazing of livestock is controlled by
  trained cowboys on horseback. Management prepares in advance to survive times
  of drought and depressed market conditions. Prescribed burns and spot
  applications of herbicide are used to control weeds and brush, enhance forage
  quality, and obtain optimum livestock distribution and grazing efficiency.
  Operation does not incorporate the use of irrigation, fertilizer, pesticides,
  and farm machinery to grow forage for livestock. Strives to maintain the herd
  in moderate to good body condition on a year-round basis. Provides the herd
  with necessary supplementation when the forage in their diet does not meet
  minimum nutrition requirements. Manages the health of the herd according to
  practices recommended by local and regional veterinarians. Considers business,
  livestock, and climate cycles when making financial management decisions.
  Dislikes government policies and programs that contribute to beef market
  oversupply, lower livestock prices, higher feed costs, overloading ranchers
  with debt, and rangeland degradation. Ranch is operated with a MINIMUM amount
  of debt. Emphasis in beef herd management is directed toward developing a
  closed-population of range-adapted, functionally superior, high-prepotent,
  general-purpose beef cattle. Emphasis in livestock marketing is directed
  toward optimizing financial returns through the direct sale of top-quality
  range-adapted breeding stock and top-quality range-aged grassfed beef. Enlists
  the use of a REGISTERED TRADE NAME when promoting the marketing of breeding
  stock and meat products. Top-quality range-aged grassfed beef is recognized as
  tasty, juicy, healthy meat processed from cattle that have reached maturity
  and are no longer growing additional carcass, and have been born, grown-out,
  and fattened on native range. Beef herd improvement is viewed as a PERPETUAL
  process of identifying and culling the influence of inferior cattle; and
  identifying and extending the influence of superior cattle. Ranch's primary
  breeding objective is to produce better bulls than their sires were and better
  cows than their dams were, and do so within the boundaries of a closed
  population of cattle. Rigid objective selection and closed-population breeding
  are used as tools for the eventual development of the type of cattle that will
  meet the ranch's breeding objective. Ranching operation is vertically
  integrated all the way to the consumer and includes standardized operating
  procedures at each step of the process. Diversification is used as a tool to
  improve ranch income. Primary emphasis in diversification is directed toward
  contracting with a private or public organization to improve the ecological
  buffering capacity of the ranch's native grazing land for the benefit of
  society and wildlife. Other methods of diversification include: breeding,
  training, and marketing horses for general ranch work as well as recreational
  riding raising and marketing sheep and goats as breeding stock, meat, and
  other valuable products providing suitable land sites for generating wind and
  solar energy marketing arts and crafts products, such as landscape art,
  leather tooling, wood working, weaving, knitting, as well as rug- and
  blanket-making providing public recreational opportunities, such as get-away
  lodging, ranch-style dining, chuck-wagon cookouts, wildlife viewing, managed
  hunting and fishing, working cowboy vacations, trail drives, and cowboy song
  and poetry concerts Management is constantly seeking out new alternative
  sources of income that are compatible with current operations. Includes sound
  financial management in every phase of the vertically integrated production
  and marketing process. Owners and managers are prodigious readers and
  aggressively pursue useful information that will give them a competitive edge.
  Ranching is viewed as a slow, steady, low-risk, long-term, generation to
  generation investment; not as a quick short-term speculative venture.
  Ecological characteristics The conservation of rangeland resources -- soil,
  water, vegetation, and wildlife -- play an important role in the ranch's
  ranching approach. Ranch's ranching approach emphasizes the benefits of
  attaining and maintaining their native grazing lands in good to excellent
  ecological condition. The use of corporate by-laws, permanent trusts,
  conservation easements, or the sell of development rights permanently protect
  the ranch's native grazing land from man-made degradation and fragmentation.
  Ranch people (i.e., owners, managers, cowboys, and other community members),
  livestock, vegetation, and wildlife coexist together in harmony within the
  rangeland ecosystem in which they are apart. Whenever possible, operation
  minimizes the use of petroleum and other carbon based energy, and optimizes
  the use of solar and wind energy. Owners and managers are constantly seeking
  out more environmentally efficient ways to reduce energy and water
  consumption, and dispose of waste materials. Social characteristics Ranching
  operation is viewed as a community where people live and work together for
  each others common benefit. Employees of the ranch live in a way that is
  personally rewarding, socially acceptable, and in ways that does not
  negatively effect the agricultural and ecological condition of the ranch's
  grazing land. Ranch employees are hard-working, peace-loving people that live
  life according to a strict code of moral, conduct, and land ethics. Owners,
  managers, and employees have a common vision of purpose, and work hard to
  achieve their common goals. Ranch provides basic needs of employees and their
  families -- functional housing, clean energy, clean water, healthy food, home
  schooling, health care, etc. -- from generation to generation, at the lowest
  feasible cost and financial risk. Ranch employees are financially rewarded for
  working hard and doing exceptional work, and for safeguarding ranch's
  infrastructure investments and livestock from physical abuse. By participating
  in producing their own food, owners and employees develop close ties to the
  land, water, plants, and animals they depend on for their existence. Ranch
  employees receive encouragement to improve themselves intellectually,
  artistically, culturally, morally, and spiritually throughout their life.
  Owners and managers of the ranch view natural resource conservation and
  environmental groups as consumers and concerned citizens, rather than
  adversaries. Whenever possible, owners and managers attempt to educate and
  inform individuals or groups about the role properly managed rangeland
  ranching can play in providing healthy food, natural fiber, and valuable
  by-products for human consumption conserving our country's native rangeland
  resources -- soil, water, vegetation, and wildlife -- for the common benefit
  of society serving as an ecological buffer against man-made climate change and
  resulting increases in global warming. Under worst conditions, the ranch
  serves as a refuge from the poverty, hunger, and anarchy created by a
  devastating disaster -- either agricultural, economic, climatic, political, or
  religious. Ranch owners, managers, and personnel strive to preserve their
  simple, peaceful, tranquil culture for present and future generations.
