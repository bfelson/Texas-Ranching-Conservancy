  Aged beef (old-time definition) - Refers to beef that is produced out of
  cattle -- heifers, steers, cows, or bulls -- that have already reached
  maturity and are no longer growing additional carcass. Old-time aged beef was
  out of cattle that were born, raised, and finished (fattened) on grass, and
  was never grainfed. Most old-time aged beef was produced out of either
  straight-bred and crossbred Texas Longhorn, Cracker, Hereford, Shorthorn,
  Angus, Jersey, and a few other breeds of cattle. Aged beef (modern-day
  definition) - Refers to beef that -- after slaughter and prior to processing
  -- has been held in storage for 10 to 30 or more days at a planned temperature
  and humidity. Modern-day aged beef may be either rangefed, pasturefed, or
  grainfed, and may be produced out of cattle of any breed, sex, age, weight, or
  size. Adapted cattle - Cattle most suited to their production environment.
  Animal unit - A 1,000 lb. (450 kg) beef cow with or without a nursing calf and
  having a daily requirement of 26 lbs. (11.8 kg) of dry forage. Animal unit
  equivalent - The calculated difference an animal of a different weight would
  exceed or fall below the standardized measurement of an animal unit.
  Biodiversity - The variety of life-forms that occur at genetic, population,
  species, community, and ecosystem levels. Sometime refers to the number and
  variety of organisms (life forms) existing in a specified geographic region,
  habitat, or environment. Breed (used as a noun) - A population of domestic
  livestock (cattle, horses, sheep, goats) that are maintained by controlled
  propagation and have common ancestors and certain distinguishable
  characteristics. Breed (used as a verb) - Causing to reproduce, especially by
  controlled mating and selection. May also mean to mate with. Business cycle -
  The financial upturn and downturn in the economy driven by demand and supply.
  Characterized by recession or depression, recovery and expansion followed by
  another round of either recession or depression. Capital - Refers to the
  resources (physical, biological, financial, and human) that are needed to
  develop, produce, and distribute goods and services for human consumption. The
  resources in question can be natural or man-made. Carbon credit - One ton of
  carbon stored in the soil and is equivalent to removing 3.67 tons of carbon
  dioxide from the atmosphere. Carcass merit - Refers to the qualities that

  desirable and/or highly palpable. There are two measures that are generally
  used to predict carcass merit. They are: (1) red-meat percent, which is
  predicted by USDA yield grade, and (2) palpability, which is predicted by USDA
  quality grade (determined primarily by marbling). It should be noted that
  yield grade is highly accurate for its purpose. Quality grade is not. Carrying
